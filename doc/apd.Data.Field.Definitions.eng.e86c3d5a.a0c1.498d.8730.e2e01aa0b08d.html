digits indicating a sub-project number. These Global Affairs Canada-assigned project numbers also appear in the data sent to the DAC-OECD to report on disbursements.</dd><dt>Date Modified</dt><dd>This date stamp indicates the day on which the project profile was published or modified. Modifications may include substantive changes to the data, such as status or budget updates, or cosmetic changes, such as correction of grammar errors in text fields.</dd><dt>Title</dt><dd>The project title as it appears in the Project Browser may not be exactly the same as it appeared in announcements or in the Proactive Disclosure reports. In the case of multi-donor projects, the title represents Global Affairs Canada's contribution only and is often different from the title used by all donors in the recipient country.</dd><dt>Description</dt><dd>The project description is for communications purposes. It usually describes the ultimate outcome, intermediate outcomes, and activities in plain language. If the project is part of a larger initiative, that initiative is usually described as well. Sometimes the description lists multiple partners; Global Affairs Canada's information systems allow only one to be coded in the system.</dd><dt>Status</dt><dd>Global Affairs Canada's projects progress through a life cycle of tentative, planning, operational, terminating, and closed. Global Affairs Canada only publishes project data after the project has been approved and is in operational status. Projects are usually moved into terminating status once activities have been completed and are changed to closed status once the final report has been accepted.</dd><dt>Start-End</dt><dd>The start and end dates are displayed in the following format: YYYY-MM-DD. The start date generally represents the date on which project activities begin. The end date represents the end of project activities by the partner or executing agency.</dd><dt>Country</dt><dd>This field indicates where the project is carried out. The location may be a country, territory, or region. A project may be carried out in more than one location. If so, the project description indicates an estimated percentage of project activities in each location. Global Affairs Canada's country pages contain more information on the department&rsquo;s activities in each country. Visit <a href="http://www.international.gc.ca/development-developpement/countries-pays/index.aspx?lang=eng">Where we work</a> to view these pages.</dd><dt>Executing Agency-Partner</dt><dd><p>The executing agency-partner can be a private firm, a non-governmental organization, an educational institution, an association, an institute, a government department, or any other individual or organization selected by Global Affairs Canada to implement the project or one of its components. "Information not available" may appear in the Executing agency-partner field when, for example, a project is operational but does not yet have an official executing agency.</p><p>Individual partner names may appear more than once in the drop-down list. This is due to errors made in the past in assigning more than one code to the same partner. Although these errors have generally been corrected in Global Affairs Canada's systems, some of the older projects that used duplicate codes are still published in the Project Browser, accounting for the duplication of the names in the list.</p><p>Please note that only one executing agency-partner can be entered in this field in Global Affairs Canada's information systems; if there are multiple partners in the project, they are usually listed in the description. Consequently, if you are using the executing agency-partner filter to generate a data set, the set will only contain those projects where the vendor chosen is the primary partner entered in this field.</p></dd><dt>Sector(s) of Focus</dt><dd>Global Affairs Canada-funded projects are categorized under eight broad sector headings: democratic governance, improving health, private sector development, strengthening basic education, environment, emergency assistance, peace and security, and other.</dd><dt>Sector</dt><dd>The sector labels and codes used are tertiary-level DAC sector codes. Global Affairs Canada's <a href="http://www.international.gc.ca/development-developpement/partners-partenaires/bt-oa/sectorcoding_sectors-codageprojets_secteurs.aspx?lang=eng">sector coding table for projects</a> is based on the OECD sector code table, allowing all donors to compare and coordinate their projects.</dd><dt>Maximum Global Affairs Canada Contribution</dt><dd><p>The value indicated in Canadian dollars corresponds to the maximum amount approved by Global Affairs Canada for the project. When the project moves to closed status, the final amount of the contribution is posted. This value could be less than the maximum amount initially approved.</p><p><strong>Note 1:</strong> The amount indicated does not automatically correspond to the amount in the contractual agreement with the organization responsible for executing the project because multiple agreements may have been signed for a single project or the amount approved may include monitoring and evaluation components. Also, Global Affairs Canada's contribution may represent only a portion of the project's total value, especially if other donors, the recipient country, or the Canadian partner invest equity in the project.</p><p><strong>Note 2:</strong> The amounts listed in the Project Browser data and in the DAC-OECD data for any given year will usually be different. The Project Browser contribution amount reflects a planned, or partially disbursed, multi-year budget in Canadian dollars, as currently entered in Global Affairs Canada's information systems, whereas the DAC-OECD contribution amount is in US dollars per calendar year, for past years, and includes contributions from other Canadian sources, not just Global Affairs Canada.</p><p><strong>Note 3:</strong> The amounts listed in the Project Browser may not always match amounts announced. In some cases, the Project Browser budget data may appear to indicate a lesser amount than that announced because the project has been split into sub-projects, the profiles of which have yet to be published. In other cases, the Project Browser data may appear to indicate an amount greater than that announced because the announcement refers only to new funding added to an existing project or because administrative/evaluation funds have not been included in the announced amount.</p></dd><dt>Expected Results</dt><dd>The information summarized in this field represents results that are expected to be achieved by the project (primary intermediate expected outcomes and immediate expected outcomes). This field is new: information will only be available for projects approved after October 15, 2011.</dd><dt>Progress and Results Achieved</dt><dd><p>The information summarized in this field represents highlights of the project's accomplishments. Unless otherwise stated, the results are cumulative and based on the most current reports available. Results are reported for the project as a whole, not just Global Affairs Canada contribution.</p><p>It is usual for many development projects to have no results to report within the first two years of activities.</p><p>Because this field is a new feature, results achieved by most older projects (for example, projects already finished in previous years and now closed) will not be published at this time.</p></dd></dl></div><div class="clear"></div><h2><a id="a2"></a>International Aid Transparency Initiative</h2><p>These are the main data elements found in Global Affairs Canada's Activity File, listed in the order in which they appear in the file. In some cases, the descriptions may differ from similar fields found in Global Affairs Canada's International Development Project Browser or other data sets.

It is made up of Global Affairs Canada's IATI Organisation Identifier (CA-3) and the Global Affairs Canada project number (as it appears in the Project Browser).

In the case of multi-donor projects, the title represents the former CIDA's contribution only and is often different from the title used by other donors.</dd><dt>Activity Description</dt><dd>Description of the project. This usually describes the goal and activities of the project in plain language. If the project is part of a larger initiative, that initiative is usually described as well. Sometimes the description lists multiple partners; at this time only the lead agency is reported.</dd><dt>Activity Status</dt><dd>Current stage of the project at the time the Activity File is published. Global Affairs Canada publishes project data once the project has been approved and is in the implementation stage (operational, in Global Affairs Canada terminology). Projects are usually moved into completion (terminating) status once activities have been completed, and go to post-completion (closed) status once the final report has been accepted.</dd><dt>Activity Dates</dt><dd>Start and end dates of the project. The start date corresponds to the date the project becomes operational (implementation stage). The end date corresponds to the planned or actual end of activities (or last payment) of the project.</dd><dt>Activity Contacts</dt><dd>Contact details for the project. Global Affairs Canada's email and mailing addresses are provided for those seeking additional information about a project.</dd><dt>Activity Website</dt><dd>Link to implementing agency's website. In most cases, implementing partners provide information on individual activities on their website. In some cases, the website might be available in English or French only, or in the language of the implementing partner's country.</dd><dt>Participating Organisation</dt><dd><p><strong>Funding:</strong> The country or institution that provides the funds. Canada is the default value.</p><p><strong>Extending:</strong> The government entity or agency within an institution that finances the activity within its own budget. The former CIDA was the extending organization until June 26, 2013. For all projects with a start date of June 26, 2013 or after, Global Affairs Canada is the extending organization.</p><p><strong>Implementing:</strong> The intermediary between the extending agency and the ultimate beneficiary, also known as the executing agency. It can be a private firm, a non-governmental organization, an educational institution, an association, an institute, a government department, or any other individual or organization selected to implement the project or one of its components. "Uncoded" may appear when, for example, a project is operational but does not yet have an official executing agency.</p><p>Organizations' names may show some variation because of errors made in the past in assigning more than one code to the same organization. Although these errors have generally been corrected in Global Affairs Canada's systems, some of the older projects that used duplicate codes are still published.</p><p>Currently, only the lead executing agency can be entered in this field in Global Affairs Canada's information systems. If there are multiple partners executing the project, they are usually listed in the description. Consequently, if the Implementing field is being used as a filter to generate a data set, the file will only contains the vendor identified as the primary partner.</p><p>At this time, Global Affairs Canada does not use the IATI Organisation Identifiers or the Organisation Type Code for all of its implementing agencies.

For non-governmental organizations (e.g. civil society, private sector) based in Canada, the Unique Identifier consists of the country ISO code (CA), the governing body for the organisation's number (Canadian Revenue Agency, CRA_ARC) and the organisation's Business Number (123456789). For example, a Canadian organization's Unique Identifier would be CA-CRA_ARC-123456789. All IATI publishers are expected to use the same Unique Identifier for a given organization.

Bilateral aid can be undertaken by Canada:<ul><li>directly with a developing country</li><li>with national or international non-governmental organizations active in development</li><li>through internal development-related transactions, such as interest subsidies, spending on development awareness, debt reorganization, and administrative costs</li><li>with multilateral organizations, when Canada effectively controls the disbursement of funds and retains a role specifying other aspects of the investment</li></ul></dd><dt>Program-based approach type</dt><dd>Program-based approaches (PBAs) are a way of engaging in development cooperation based on the principles of co-ordinated support for a locally owned development program, such as a national development strategy, a sector or thematic program, or a specific organization's program. PBAs share the following features: leadership by the recipient country organization; a single comprehensive program and budget framework; and a formalized process for donor co-ordination and harmonization of donor procedures for reporting, budgeting, financial management and procurement. There are four possible values for this field:<ul><li><strong>General budget support (GBS)</strong> - A general contribution to a recipient country's overall budget where the policy dialogue between donors and the country government is focused on overall policy and budget priorities.</li><li><strong>Sectoral budget support (SBS)</strong> - Similar to GBS but is earmarked to a discrete sector or sectors, with any conditionality relating to these sectors.</li><li><strong>Pooled funding</strong> - An arrangement negotiated between multiple donors and the recipient to finance a specific program. Pooled funding involves donor control or oversight upon release of funds to the recipient country and in terms of financial reporting, which is expected to show how the funds were used. The scope of the use of the pooled funds may be very broad, but more typically such funds are focused on a subset of sector activities.</li><li><strong>Other PBA support</strong> - Other PBA support, such as project funding, can be used within a PBA with the use of Global Affairs Canada funds for specific activities. Projects carried out in the context of a PBA often take place as agreed elements within a sector-wide approach. As such, they are distinct from stand-alone projects. They are characterized by the adoption of a more collaborative approach to decision making and the close involvement of the recipient country or organization in the project design and management.</li></ul></dd><dt>Policy markers (Environmental sustainability; Climate change adaptation; Climate change mitigation; Desertification; Participatory development and good governance; Trade development; Biodiversity; Urban issues; Children issues; Youth issues; Indigenous issues; Disability issues; Information and communications technologies as a tool for development; Knowledge for development)</dt><dd>The data set contains 15 policy markers. These policy markers are descriptive rather than quantitative. The indicators are complementary to the sector classification (refer to Sector identification, Sector name). Policy markers, however, are not directly associated to expenditures and apply to the whole investment. They cover the areas of economic well-being, social development, environment sustainability and regeneration, democratic accountability, protection of human rights, and the rule of law. Data collection on the policy objectives of aid is based on a marking system with three values, with the exception of gender equality, which has four possible values (refer to Policy markers&mdash;Gender equality).</dd><dt>Policy markers&mdash;Gender equality</dt><dd>Unlike other policy markers, the gender equality marker can have four possible values, the meaning of which also depends on the Global Affairs Canada business delivery model (that is, directive and responsive vs. long-term institutional support). As indicated by Global Affairs Canada's Policy on Gender Equality, gender equality must be explicitly and systematically integrated into all of Global Affairs Canada's policies, programs and investments. Global Affairs Canada measures the level of integration into the Agency's investments (for directive and responsive programming) or the capacity of an institution to integrate gender equality (for long-term institutional support).</dd><dt>Organization identification, Organization name</dt><dd>The organization(s) receiving Global Affairs Canada funding to implement the project or one of its components.

Global Affairs Canada's sector coding table for projects is based on the OECD sector code table, allowing all donors to compare and coordinate their projects. Sectors refer to the specific area of the recipient's economic or social structure the aid is intended to foster. Many projects foster more than one sector. The sector percent field estimates the actual cost (or best estimate thereof) for achieving a particular output.</dd><dt>Note 1</dt><dd>The amounts listed in the Project Browser data and in the OECD/DAC data for any given year will usually be different. The Project Browser contribution amount reflects a planned, or partially disbursed, multi-year budget in Canadian dollars, as currently entered in Global Affairs Canada's information systems, whereas the OECD/DAC contribution amount is in US dollars per calendar year, for past years, and includes contributions from other Canadian sources, not just Global Affairs Canada.</dd><dt>Note 2</dt><dd>For the majority of Global Affairs Canada's projects, identifying the aid recipient(s) is straightforward. For certain projects, however, estimating the amount of Global Affairs Canada's aid going to a specific country/region can be complex. This is especially true for multilateral aid, when Global Affairs Canada provides general financial support to multilateral organizations whose actions are compatible with Global Affairs Canada's objectives. A similar situation happens with regional programs that address regional issues countries of a region face together. Often, the exact recipient countries are not well known in advance. In the case of long-term institutional support, Global Affairs Canada relies on the reporting of multilateral organizations to the OECD/DAC. Other times, Global Affairs Canada project officers make the best available estimate on project creation and review those estimates as the project evolves. This, in part, explains the minor discrepancies between the Historical Data Set and the Statistical Report on Financial Assistance.</dd><dt>Note 3</dt><dd><p>Tied aid is a practice that requires aid funds be used for the procurement of goods and services in the donor country or in a limited number of countries. This practice has, in most cases, a negative impact on cost efficiency and aid effectiveness, as it can limit competition, increase transportation costs, delay the delivery of goods, prevent capacity building in developing countries, and result in the provision of products that are not adapted to local conditions.</p><p>Starting in 2001, OECD/DAC members agreed to untie certain categories of aid to least developed countries (LDCs), as stated in the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/countries/nicaragua/41707972.pdf">DAC Recommendation on Untying ODA</a> (PDF, 1 MB, 15 pages), amended in 2006 and 2008. In the 2008 Accra Agenda for Action, Canada and other donors committed to make further progress in untying aid, to extend coverage to heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs), and to improve reporting on untying. The recommendation does not restrict the prerogative of DAC members to untie official development assistance to a greater extent. As such, in addition to untying all of its food aid as of April 1, 2008, the Minister of International Cooperation announced in September 2008 that, by 2012-&shy;2013, all Canadian aid will be untied as per the amended DAC recommendation and that untying would apply to all countries receiving Canadian aid (not only some groups, such as LDCs and HIPCs).</p><p>Management services and technical cooperation (refer to FSTC percent) are excluded from the specific coverage of the DAC recommendation. In other words, untying is encouraged but not mandatory for projects falling into those categories; aid effectiveness and programming are the decisive factors.</p></dd></dl></div><div class="clear"></div><h2><a id="a5"></a>Maternal, Newborn and Child Health</h2><div class="span-6"><dl class="wet-boew-zebra"><dt>Fiscal year</dt><dd>Refers to the fiscal year in which the disbursements (refer to Amount spent) were made. Global Affairs Canada uses the fiscal-year basis adopted by the Government of Canada (April to March). For example, the 2014&minus;2015 fiscal year began April 1, 2014, and will end March 31, 2015.</dd><dt>Commitment</dt><dd>Indicates if the project belongs to the Muskoka Initiative ($1.1B) or to the Maternal, Newborn and Child Health (MNCH) Baseline ($1.75B).</dd><dt>Branch name</dt><dd>This field represents Global Affairs Canada's area of responsibility for budgetary monitoring and reporting. Use this field to identify which part of Global Affairs Canada's organization is managing the project. Global Affairs Canada's four main development programming branches are the Geographic Programs Branch (B3000), Afghanistan and Pakistan Task Force (D4125), Multilateral and Global Programs Branch (B5100), and Partnership with Canadians (B6100).</dd><dt>Project number</dt><dd>This is a unique identifier used to identify projects in Global Affairs Canada's information systems. The first seven digits indicate a project, while the last three digits indicate a sub-project number. These numbers also appear in the data sent to the OECD/DAC. Note that in this data set, any given project number could repeat over several rows because implementation across several countries and sectors is common.</dd><dt>Project title</dt><dd>The project title as it appears in the Project Browser or this file may not be exactly the same as it appeared in announcements or in the Proactive Disclosure reports. In the case of multi-donor projects, the title represents Global Affairs Canada's contribution only and is often different from the title used by all donors in the recipient country.</dd><dt>Continent name</dt><dd>These fields indicate the continent(s) in which the project is carried out. The continent-to-mapping convention is based on the Composition of macro geographical (continental) regions list published by the United Nations Statistics Division.</dd><dt>Country/Region identification code, Country/Region name, Country/Region percent</dt><dd>These fields indicate where the project is carried out. The location may be a country or a region. Additionally, a project may be carried out in more than one location. The country/Region percent field indicates the estimated percentage of project activities in each location. Country identifications are based on the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 convention, while the Region identifications are based on a number of conventions, including lists maintained by the United Nations Statistics Division, the Development Assistance Committee questionnaire, as well as on Global Affairs Canada's internal system conventions.</dd><dt>Sector identification code, Sector name, Sector percent</dt><dd>The sector labels and codes used are tertiary-level DAC sector codes. Global Affairs Canada's sector coding table for projects is based on the OECD sector code table, allowing all donors to compare and coordinate their projects. Sectors refer to the specific area of the recipient's economic or social structure the aid is intended to foster. Many projects foster more than one sector. The sector percent field estimates the actual cost (or best estimate thereof) for achieving a particular output.</dd><dt>Amount spent</dt><dd>This value, indicated in Canadian dollars, corresponds to the money paid out by Global Affairs Canada. Each line contains a value, which represents the lowest and most detailed level: the estimated amount paid out to an organization to implement an aid project, in whole or in part, for a specific fiscal year, for a given location (country or region) and for a given sector. Unlike the maximum contribution field, this field can be aggregated at any level (fiscal year, country, sector, organization, delivery model, etc). Note that an assumption is made that every organization implementing an aid project works in all estimated countries and sectors, which may not always be the case.</dd><dt>Multilateral G8 Methodology</dt><dd>The project uses the imputed percentage attributed to multilateral contributions according to the <a href="http://www.g8.utoronto.ca/summit/2010muskoka/methodology.html">G8 Muskoka 2010 Methodology for Calculating Baselines and Commitments</a>.</dd><dt>Thematic Priority</dt><dd>This refers to the Government of Canada&rsquo;s three <a href="http://www.international.gc.ca/development-developpement/priorities-priorites/index.aspx">priority themes</a> for development: increasing food security, securing the future of children and youth, and stimulating sustainable economic growth.</dd><dt>MNCH Code</dt><dd>This code is from the <a href="http://www.g8.utoronto.ca/summit/2010muskoka/methodology.html">G8 Muskoka 2010 Methodology for Calculating Baselines and Commitments</a>. For multilateral contributions, the code represents the organization funded. For bilateral contributions under the Maternal, Newborn and Child Health (MNCH) Baseline, the code indicates the Sector identification used.</dd><dt>MNCH Percentage</dt><dd>This is the imputed percentage attributed to multilateral contributions according to the G8 Muskoka 2010 Methodology for Calculating Baselines and Commitments.</dd><dt>Muskoka Path</dt><dd>This text information shows which of the <a href="http://www.international.gc.ca/development-developpement/priorities-priorites/mnch-smne/index.aspx?lang=eng">Muskoka</a> paths the project contributes to: strengthening health systems; reducing the burden of diseases; or improving nutrition. Some projects contribute to more than one path.</dd><dt>MNCH Amount Spent</dt><dd>This value, indicated in Canadian dollars, corresponds to the amount disbursed under the Muskoka Initiative or the Maternal, Newborn and Child Health (MNCH) Baseline.</dd><dt>Note:</dt><dd>The amounts listed in the Project Browser data and in the OECD/DAC data for any given year will usually be different.
